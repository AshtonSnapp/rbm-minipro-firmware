# rbm-minipro-firmware

This is an archive of firmware files for the "Minipro" TL866A/CS and TL866II+, for use by RetroBrewMGR (rbm)

Want to use this to update your minipro without having to grab rbm?

Download the update.sh file in the folder for your device and it'll do the work for you (or just grab the file in the folder with the highest number and do it manually)! Obviously this assumes you are using Linux or macOS and are using the unofficial minipro software.

If a new version of the firmware for either device is available, please raise an Issue (preferrably with a link to where I can grab it) and I'll get that done ASAP. You can also submit a pull request once I figure out an automated way to check for malicious code in the update shell scripts. Once I do, any pull requests where the check goes off will be denied (and of course I will also check it manually just in case). Until I do, *all* pull requests will be denied.
